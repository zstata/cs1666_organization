# CS1666 Managment Weeks

Each team will need to construct a Markdown file to note who will manage the
team for each management week. If your team does not have 11 members, you can
list "NONE" for any unused management week. Each student must be a manager for
a single week. A template form for end of managment week reports can be found
in `TEMPLATE_mgmt_report__NAME.md`. Before sending a copy to me, rename it so
as to remove the "TEMPLATE" and change "NAME" to your name. Each team member's
Effort rating should be on the following scale:

* -2: No effort or next-to no effort
* -1: Insufficient effort
* 0: Sufficient effort
* 1: Extra effort
* 2: Overwhelming effort

I will be happy if everyone earns a 0 for each week all term, and will be
unhappy if there are alot of -2's and +2's earned (both indicate an imbalance
of effort).
